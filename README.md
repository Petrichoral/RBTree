# RBTree
A general Red-Black Tree library for C. Not supported in any way, shape, or form.

This library was made in response to creating a Map Reduce system. I've not needed it in any way so I thought I'd
put it on github incase someone wanted to learn from this, employers to look at it, or for me to observe it in
retrospect.
